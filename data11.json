  "Summary":["During a demonstration flight, a U.S. Army flyer flown by Orville Wright nose-dived into the ground from a height of approximately 75 feet, killing Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge who was a passenger. This was the first recorded airplane fatality in history.  One of two propellers separated in flight, tearing loose the wires bracing the rudder and causing the loss of control of the aircraft.  Orville Wright suffered broken ribs, pelvis and a leg.

Departure from San Juan with known electrical problems and discharged batteries. Ditched in the Gulf of Mexico after it ran out of fuel. Offical cause unknown.","Crashed into Mt. Arbetello in poor visibility. Poor visibility and geographical features made recognition of terrain difficult and likely mislead the pilot into believing he was out at sea.","The aircraft took off in fog with a group of Yale University students returning to school following their Christmas vacation.  About midway down the runway the plane swerved to the left and became airborne.  The left wing dropped the wing tip dragged on the runway.  After about 750 feet, the tail wheel made contact with the runway.  The engines were cut and the plane skidded for 700 feet until it hit a hanger and burst into flames.  The accident was caused by the crew's attempt to take off in an airplane which had formations of ice and frost on the surfaces of the wings.  In addition, the plane was overloaded by 1,500 lbs.","A blown tire during takeoff led to damage to the landing gear, engine and oil line. Lack of oil caused loss of the engine and the crew was not able to feather the prop. This led to overspeeding and an engine fire. The plane made a spiral descent and crashed to the ground.","Cargo plane. The loss of control of the aircraft which resulted from an icing condition, turbulence, and lack of alertness on the part of the crew. As a result, the aircraft spun, and during the spins, or attempted recovery from the spins, severe airloads were encountered which failed the left horizontal stabilizer and the elevators.","The aircraft crashed shortly after taking off.

The action of the pilot in proceeding off the designated airway at an altitude insufficient to clear the terrain.","Midair collision. Two killed on the Cessna, none on the Lockheed which laned safely. The joint failure of the Constellation pilots to observe and avoid the Cessna aircraft in flight and of the Cessna pilot, while on an airway and in an area where a heavy concentration of trafficould be expected, to remain alert and avoid the Constellation.The aircraft was named Clipper Monarch of the Skies.","","The No. 4, followed by the No. 3 engines failed on initial approach. The plane lost altitude and crashed into trees.  Failure of the captain to maintain a safe height, by utilizing the available power of the starboard engines after power failure in the port engine. The reason for this failure by the captain cannot be determined. The power failure in the port engines was caused by fuel starvation brought about by an insuffuciency of fuel in the port tanks. This fuel shortage was the result of the wing tanks being allowed to become progressively unbalanced during the last stage of the flight.","Crashed while attempting to land.","Crashed in the sea off the Swedish coast after the pilot was told to enter a holding pattern for Copenhagen, since it was closed to inbound traffic. The aircraft was directed to land on Runway 22 but failed to make the landing. The wreckage was found a month later on the bottom of the ocean.
